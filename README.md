# SvelteHyperLazy
Is a enhanced lazy load package desired for Svelte; Allow lazy load images and videos

## Points for use our solution
1. Allows to use Lazy Loading for images and videos
2. Has option to add **base image** which should be a smaller image displaying before full version had loaded


## **Developement stage assumptions sorted by pitches**

### **Information:** We are decent so we're gaining each level in descending order  (From Basic to Advanced)

***Basic***
1. Show empty element until base element won't be attached
2. Load full element only when user is seeing an element

***Medium***
